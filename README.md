# wpchange
dynamically changing wallpaper (gtk3)

This app changes the gnome wallpaper similar to macOS' dynamic wallpaper
you can make your own themes where you can assign an image to a specific time
you can change the theme from a tray icon menu ![Alt text](Screenshot from 2018-12-26 19-27-55.png?raw=true "tray menu")


you need ruby on your system
install the needed gems with ```bundle install```

the default theme is not the best design work but you might get the idea
